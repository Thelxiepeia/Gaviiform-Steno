# Gaviiform-Steno
The Gaviiform steno dialect or theory is the way that I write stenographically. I want to share this with people in order to further the Open Steno Project's goal of bringing steno to everybody!

The resources are under construction, but you can go to the Wiki tab to see them in their current messy glory. Many parts are missing.

This is not necessarily the best theory. It might not even be a good theory. It may not make sense. I just know it's how I write. 

During a dictionary management project that I'm still not finished with, I realized that my style of writing has deviated a lot from how I was taught--sufficiently enough to make its own "theory." But the drawback of warping things like this is that it was not designed with learners in mind. I apologize.
